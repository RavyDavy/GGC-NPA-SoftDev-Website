                <h3>Midsummer Carnival</h3>
                <p>
                    Our Midsummer was celebrated with a full blown carnival! The rides and stalls were run by <a href="https://showmensguild.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="The Showmen's Guild of Great Britain">The Showmen's Guild of Great Britain</a>
                    <br><br>
                    We had lots of fun rides and attractions, to suit all ages of children and adults. We also had street food, and our favourite sweet treats: Popcorn and Candy Floss.

                <h3>Easter (Spring) Break</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the Spring Break fortnight, we put on events to entertain the kids.
                    <br><br>
                    We had an egg event, where eggs were painted in our non-toxic paints, before being rolled down a hill in an "egg-race", with participants recieving hand-made chocolate Easter Eggs.
                    <br><br>
                    We also had a great Easter Egg Hunt, where the children hunted for stone ornamental eggs, which got traded for chocolate treats.

                <h3>Christmas Festive Break</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the Christmas Break last year, we had a ton of fun. Our Santa's Grotto was our most popular attraction, but our Raindeer pulling the sleigh was a close second.
                    <br><br>
                    We also had a mini-disco event for the children, and our shop stocked some festive-special only items such as hand-made crackers, and beautifully decorated Christmas Tree ornaments.

                <h3>Halloween</h3>
                <p>
                    On the weekend before Halloween, Saturday 28th and Sunday 29th October, we had a spooky Halloween Event.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone was encouraged to dress-up (even Fluffy the rabbit, as seen in the photo above), and we seen some fantastic costumes - a great effort was made by all!
                    <br><br>
                    Other events we had were pumpkin picking and carving, and also in good old fashion Scottish tradition, some even carved turnips. We also had apple-dooking, and a mini-disco too.
