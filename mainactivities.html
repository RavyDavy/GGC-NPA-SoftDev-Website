                <p>
                    We have 3 main forest trail walks starting from the Farm. They are classed as <mark style="background-color:green;">Easy</mark>, <mark style="background-color: yellow;">Medium</mark>, and <mark style="background-color: orange;">Challenging</mark>, depending on the distance each walk actually is.
                    <br><br>
                    The <mark style="background-color:green;">Easy</mark> Walk is around 3 miles. The <mark style="background-color: yellow;">Medium</mark> Walk is around 5 miles, and our <mark style="background-color: orange;">Challenging</mark> Walk is around 10 miles.
                    <br><br>
                    All of our walks take in the beautiful scenary  of the countryside around our Farm.
                    <br><br>
                    Please wear sensible shoes for doing any of the walks, including waterproof boots or wellies for wet weather.
