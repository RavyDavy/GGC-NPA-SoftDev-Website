                <p>
                    Hi there, and Welcome to our Website!
                    <br>
                    We are a working farm/visitor's centre located near Biggar.
                    <br><br>
                    We have tons of fun for all the family! From our petting zoo, to our woodland walks, and from our children's adventure park to our home-baked cakes in our cafe, we have something for everyone.
                    <br><br>
                    Feel free to look around and read about all our great attractions (and our special Seasonal Activities), and our well stocked farm shop.
