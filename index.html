                <p>
                    Hi there, and Welcome to our Website!
                    <br>
                    We are a working farm/visitor's centre located near Biggar.
                    <br><br>
                    We have tons of fun for all the family! From our petting zoo, to our woodland walks, and from our children's adventure park to our home-baked cakes in our cafe, we have something for everyone.
                    <br><br>
                    Feel free to look around and read about all our great attractions (and our special Seasonal Activities), and our well stocked farm shop.

                    Say Hello to our newest member of our petting zoo.
