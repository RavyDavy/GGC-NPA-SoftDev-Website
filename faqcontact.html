Animal food costs 50p per cup, and is suitable for all our large animals. Animals can only be fed with the animal feed provided on the farm.

Our activities are best suited to kids between ages 2 - 12, however we also get many children younger and older than this who tell us they've had a brilliant time. Everything in the farm is designed to be enjoyed by adults too, so that children can experience playing and learning with their parents!</li>
                        <li><b>Can you bring a buggy?</b> - Yes you can bring buggy's to the farm. You are also able to pop in and out to the car park if wish to put your buggy away. </li>
                        <li><b>Can you pay with card/cash?</b> - The reception, shop and cafe all accept both card and cash.</li>
                        <li><b>What shoes should you wear? Footwear?</b> - The park is paved and gravel paths so any trainers or boots are fine. Perhaps wellies for wet day for any puddles! We would NOT recommend heels, sandals, dress shoes, or any footwear or clothing that you would like to keep nice.</li>
